Data types and the console
--------------------------
The absolute most important thing in programming is being able to store data. That's why we have variables.
You can think of a variable as a box. Each box stores whatever information you put in it. Better still, these boxes are labelled, so you can quickly access it and it's contents later!


Data type	Definition	Example/s [Data types with an asterisk (*) before them aren't directly applicable to JavaScript, but it is still good to know them.]
*Integer	A whole quantity or amount (without a fractional component).	123
*Long	A very large quantity or amount (without a fractional component).	123456789
*Float	A number with a fractional component.	123.456
*Double	A high precision float (can accurately store numbers with more decimal places than a float can).	123.456789
Number	A quantity or amount. Decimal numbers are represented with the ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Numbers can be negative (less than 0), this is signified with a hyphen/dash/subtraction sign (-). Numbers can also have decimal components, this is signified with a full stop/period (.) followed by the decimal component of the number.	A whole number: 123. A negative number -123. A decimal number 123.456.
*Char	A single character.	a or & or 0 etc
String	A collection of chars forming some text. In JavaScript, strings start and finish with one of quotation marks (""), apostrophes ('') or backticks (``) (must start and finish with the same one).	The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
Boolean	Either true or false.	true or false
Array -	A list-like (this can depend on the programming language you are using) collection of data, most commonly symbolised with square braces/brackets ([]). Each item in an array has an index (its position in the array, starting at 0). An item can be accessed using square bracket 'notation' (array[index]).	[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
Object -	A special structure grouping data together. In JavaScript, this is through properties and values, almost identical to JSON (which actually stands for JavaScript Object Notation). Objects are a more advanced concept so we will look at them much more in depth later.	{ name: "Matthew", age: 16 }

To print to the JavaScript console, we need to use the built-in function, console.log. We'll learn more about functions and what we're actually doing later, for now we just need to be able to see the different data types in action.

After console.log, we need opening and closing parenthesis/brackets (()). Inside the parenthesis/brackets, we can put the data we want to print.

Lastly, in JavaScript, as a general rule we finish statements (like the one you're learning) with a semicolon (;), the semicolon is the full stop of the programming world! (Semicolons aren't technically required in JavaScript, however I personally believe it is good practice to always include them.)

console.log(123);
console.log(123.456);
console.log("Hello world!");
console.log([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]);
console.log(true);
console.log(false);


Functions
---------
A function is like a shortcut to run a specific block of code based on some parameters (literally).

A basic function looks like this: function keyword is necessary.

function function_name() { 
	// some code
}
